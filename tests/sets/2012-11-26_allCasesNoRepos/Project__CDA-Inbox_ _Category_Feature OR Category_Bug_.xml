Hi,

 

This observed with client Chandler- Mercy Gilbert. I wanted to file a bug for the data manager application wherein I am having trouble creating the mapping once the file has been uploaded  under supplemental loads.  Here are the following steps to replicate this bug:

 

1.       Navigate to the newly created supplemental load , datacheckupadds.

2.       Click on create mapping for load slot ICD9Diagnosis.

3.       Once this is done select tab delimiter, and enter destination table name and mapping name.

4.       Once this is done, click create mapping multiple times.

5.       Expected results are multiple column mapping slots should show up, but actual results are that only one column is created even after clicking on map columns multiple times. This is as the screen shot shown below:

 

 

 

Please reach out to me if you have any questions.

I wanted to file a bug for the data manager application wherein I am having trouble creating the mapping once the file has been uploaded&nbsp; under supplemental loads.&nbsp; Here are the following steps to replicate this bug:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Navigate to the newly created supplemental load , datacheckupadds.<br /><br />2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Click on create mapping for load slot ICD9Diagnosis.<br /><br />3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once this is done select tab delimiter, and enter destination table name and mapping name.<br /><br />4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Once this is done, click create mapping multiple times.<br /><br />5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Expected results are multiple column mapping slots should show up, but actual results are that only one column is created even after clicking on map columns multiple times. This is as the screen shot shown below:<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Please reach out to me if you have any questions.<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />&nbsp;<br /><br />Nisha Rao<br />]]></sHtml></event><event ixBugEvent="188699" ixBug="46531"><ixBugEvent>188699</ixBugEvent><evt>3</evt><sVerb><![CDATA[Assigned]]></sVerb><ixPerson>332</ixPerson><ixPersonAssignedTo>332</ixPersonAssignedTo><dt>2012-08-08T18:07:35Z</dt><s></s><fEmail>false</fEmail><fHTML>false</fHTML><fExternal>false</fExternal><sChanges></sChanges><sFormat></sFormat><rgAttachments></rgAttachments><evtDescription><![CDATA[Assigned to Cody Rees by Cody Rees]]></evtDescription><bEmail>false</bEmail><bExternal>false</bExternal><sPerson><![CDATA[Cody Rees]]></sPerson><sHtml></sHtml></event><event ixBugEvent="188850" ixBug="46531"><ixBugEvent>188850</ixBugEvent><evt>3</evt><sVerb><![CDATA[Assigned]]></sVerb><ixPerson>332</ixPerson><ixPersonAssignedTo>176</ixPersonAssignedTo><dt>2012-08-08T19:24:55Z</dt><s><![CDATA[(I met with Nisha and had her walk me through this issue. After reviewing it with her, it appears to be a defect. I'm assigning the priority as "High" since it appears that working functionality was lost with the recent Troubleshooting Wizard redesign.)

DESCRIPTION OF ISSUE:

There are scenarios when users upload files to a load requirement that doesn't have a destination table specified (when the table is created after the file has been received, for example).

In previous versions of DataManager, when a file was uploaded to a load requirement that doesn't have a destination table specified, the user would normally then use the troubleshooting wizard to create the mapping.

In Edsel, the Troubleshooting Wizard is not behaving as expected so as to allow this functionality. Additionally, the behavior of DataManager is different when attempting to do this from either the "Scheduled Loads" or "Supplemental Loads" tabs (the behavior on both is incorrect). 

The faulty behavior on each tab is as follows:

- (From the "Supplemental Loads" tab): Only one row is provided for the user to map columns. Clicking the "Map Columns" button does not generate an additional row (as it did in previous versions) for the user to be able to map all the columns.

- (From the "Scheduled Loads" tab): Clicking the "Map Columns" button does correctly generate the additional row as expected, but each row does not have the drop-down box containing the file columns as expected (when doing this from the "Supplemental Loads" tab this drop-down box is present).

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1. Create a load requirement that does not have the "Destination Table" field populated.

2. From either the "Scheduled Loads" or "Supplemental Loads" tabs, upload a valid file to the load req from step 1.

3. After uploading the file, open the Troubleshooting Wizard for that file. Specify the delimiter and specify a destination table that doesn't yet exist. 

4.a ("Supplemental Loads" tab) A row for mapping the columns should be visible. Specify the file column and destination table column then click the "Map Columns" button. Note that an additional row is not generated as expected.

4.b ("Scheduled Loads" tab) A row for mapping the columns should be visible. Note that the drop-down box containing the file's columns is not present, but clicking the "Map Columns" button does correctly generate the additional rows as expected.

ACTUAL/EXPECTED RESULTS:

Expected: The user is able to use the Troubleshooting Wizard to adequately create the mapping to a non-existent table.

Actual: The user is unable to adequately create the mapping to a non-existent table from the Troubleshooting Wizard because the interface is either not providing additional rows, or the pre-populated drop-down.

                The CMA services team has discovered an intricacy with the way that DMV handles schema migration, which is hindering our migration to our newest release.  When a schema is created or migrated via DMV3 any constraints created end up with non-uniform names.  When the schema is created or migrated via development’s migration loader (via Citadel) the constraints are created in a uniform way.  An example of a DMV created constraint is ‘DF__Physician__Prima__65370702’ and the corresponding Citadel created constraint is ‘DF_Physicians_PrimarySpecialty’.  This causes our migration scripts to abort when trying to drop this constraint, as the correctly named constraint does not exist.  We need to understand and fix this functionality ASAP.  Could you please provide an ETA on this or an explanation of root cause if possible?

>The CMA services team has discovered an intricacy with the way that DMV handles schema migration, which is hindering our migration to our newest release.  When a schema is created or migrated via DMV3 any constraints created end up with non-uniform names.

This is an issue that is currently interrupting our process, currently.

Andy, Curt,

I wanted to follow up with both of you to make sure that:

a. This issue is indeed "Urgent" and
b. That it has been triaged properly so that it receives appropriate attention.

Curt, this is currently in the defect queue. Should I assign it to a developer?

Subject: Urgent DMV Migration Issue - CMA

>CDA Support Team,
>
>The CMA services team has discovered an intricacy with the way that DMV handles schema migration, which is hindering our migration to our newest release.  When a schema is created or migrated via DMV3 any constraints created end up with non-uniform names.  When the schema is created or migrated via development's migration loader (via Citadel) the constraints are created in a uniform way.  An example of a DMV created constraint is 'DF__Physician__Prima__65370702' and the corresponding Citadel created constraint is 'DF_Physicians_PrimarySpecialty'.  This causes our migration scripts to abort when trying to drop this constraint, as the correctly named constraint does not exist.  We need to understand and fix this functionality ASAP.  Could you please provide an ETA on this or an explanation of root cause if possible?

We tried to reproduce this issue and we failed to reproduce the same.
I have cross checked few Production Databases (migrated through Datamanager) with the help of services, to verify the same and all the constraint names seems to be fine.
Data manager works as a wrapper to Schema Util which migrates the Database with all the scripts provided by the CMA team.

If you can provide me any DB which has this issue, i can look further into the same.

Steps to reproduce. 
1. Create a new client in DMV
2. Add a dummy file to a dummy load requirement
3. Extract file with migration

This will create the initial schema for the DB.  If you look at the constraints on the physicians table you will notice that they are named with some letters and numbers and not with the standard naming convention.  If you give me the steps you used to try to reproduce I would be happy to review that.

Subject: RE: (Case 35597) Urgent DMV Migration Issue - CMA<br />
<br />
&gt;This is an issue that we discovered yesterday as these incorrectly named constraints were causing our schema migrations to fail.&nbsp; We have put a workaround in place (manually running the migrate loader from Citadel if the problem exists), so this may not be &quot;Urgent&quot;.&nbsp; This is an issue that is currently interrupting our process, currently.<br />

Andy, Curt,

I wanted to follow up with both of you to make sure that:

a. This issue is indeed "Urgent" and
b. That it has been triaged properly so that it receives appropriate attention.

Curt, this is currently in the defect queue. Should I assign it to a developer?

Subject: Urgent DMV Migration Issue - CMA

>CDA Support Team,
>
>The CMA services team has discovered an intricacy with the way that DMV handles schema migration, which is hindering our migration to our newest release.  When a schema is created or migrated via DMV3 any constraints created end up with non-uniform names.  When the schema is created or migrated via development's migration loader (via Citadel) the constraints are created in a uniform way.  An example of a DMV created constraint is 'DF__Physician__Prima__65370702' and the corresponding Citadel created constraint is 'DF_Physicians_PrimarySpecialty'.  This causes our migration scripts to abort when trying to drop this constraint, as the correctly named constraint does not exist.  We need to understand and fix this functionality ASAP.  Could you please provide an ETA on this or an explanation of root cause if possible?

We could able to reproduce this issue, but the issue seems to be with SchemaUtil. I will be discussing with CMA dev for analysing the way they are invoking the SchemaUtil from the loader, which might help us to sort out the difference.

FYI: Both the constraint names in the source script and the destination database needs to be same while using Schema Util. When the source db table is not created with the constraint name similar to that of destination db constraint name, schema util thinks otherwise and tries to drop and recreate constraints which then fails. Hence source db table
Physicians with column PrimarySpecialty should have 'default' constraint named as ‘DF_Physicians_PrimarySpecialty’. Then you need to create tables scripts.

I tried testing the schema migration decoupling that was a part of the CDA release last night and it does not appear to work.  I selected “Suppress auto schema migration” for Catholic Health and Memorial Hermann in DMV3 but when I then went to extract files for the members the “Migrate Schema” checkbox was pre-selected.  This should not be the case if the suppression is selected.  Can you please look into this as this really is a functionality that we need to work reliably.

I tried testing the schema migration decoupling that was a part of the CDA release last night and it does not appear to work.&nbsp; I selected &#8220;Suppress auto schema migration&#8221; for Catholic Health and Memorial Hermann in DMV3 but when I then went to extract files for the members the &#8220;Migrate Schema&#8221; checkbox was pre-selected.&nbsp; This should not be the case if the suppression is selected.&nbsp; Can you please look into this as this really is a functionality that we need to work reliably.<br />

I wonder if this is an IE9 issue (which we probably still need to at least get that looked into as everyone will be moving to it soon).  It seems to work now in my Chrome with IE tab but still doesn't work in my IE.  Do you have the ability to also test on IE9 to see your results?

I wonder if this is an IE9 issue (which we probably still need to at least get that looked into as everyone will be moving to it soon).  It seems to work now in my Chrome with IE tab but still doesn't work in my IE.  Do you have the ability to also test on IE9 to see your results?

Hi Simon

When we tried to verify the same, it was working the way we desired. I have attached the screen shot for the same.
This seems to be a browser caching issue. Can you clear the cache and check the same once again and let us know.

Regards
Guruprasad

We recently discovered that if a user doesn't have compatibility mode selected in IE 9, some things don't display correctly.  You said that you were getting the correct display in Chrome but not in IE 9.  Can you make sure that you have compatibility mode selected in IE 9, and, if not, select it and see if you still get this problem?

Thanks,

Finding that setting in IE9 is much more difficult than other versions though.  This needs to be kept in account as we roll out more of Crimson to IE9 (which is currently going on).

Thanks for the update.  I have raised with Asa the need to let everyone know that if they migrate to IE 9, they need to turn on IE 9's compatibility mode.  (We just discovered this a couple of days ago.)  Sorry for any inconvenience,

I ran into a critical error today with Forrest General that needs to be addressed ASAP in case it occurs with other automated members.  I will give you a timeline of events and the emails I received:

 

June 1 – All mandatory SFTP files sent from Forrest General to Crimson

June 1 – Extract automatically kicked off and failed (see email message)

 

This e-mail is to notify you that the extract load you started for Load Instance April 2012 at 05:22 PM has been completed. There were one or more errors during the load. Your Business Analyst has been notified and is currently investigating the errors.

 

June 4 – I didn’t have a chance to address these errors in the extract and had this on my list for today

June 5 – Paul Defreese uploaded additional Core Measure files (Paul does not have approval permissions)

June 5 – Extract load kicked off and diagnostics were automatically approved (let me emphasize Paul does not have these permissions to extract or approve)

 

The following file has been uploaded

'E:\\dmv3\\UploadedFiles\\ForrestGeneral\\May 2012\14-11-10-AM-06-05-2012HF Episode List 2011 Q4.csv'.

 

*****

 

This e-mail is to notify you that the Crimson Support staff has received diagnostic report approval for Load Instance April 2012. The report was approved by user pdefreese at 06/05/2012 10:19 AM. Crimson staff will now initiate the next phase in the load process.

 

Please contact crimsonsupport@advisory.com for further information.

 

This is an automated email response. Direct replies to this email will not be received by Crimson Support staff.

 

******

This e-mail is to notify you that the diagnostic report for Load Instance April 2012 was approved by user pdefreese at 06/05/2012 10:19 AM.

 

Upon approval, the internal load was kicked off for Member ForrestGeneral.

 

 

We absolutely cannot be kicking these off if the actual approvers have not even seen the diagnostics.  Can you please track this down and let me know what happened?

 

Thanks,
Mary

I have couple of doubts.

1. Is Multi-Approval enabled for the client? If not then Paul's approval would kick off migration.
2. Once all the files are uploaded the extract would be kicked off. So paul will have access to run extract load indirectly.

It will be helpful to proceed with these informations.

<br />
I have couple of doubts.<br />
<br />
1. Is Multi-Approval enabled for the client? If not then Paul's approval would kick off migration.<br />
2. Once all the files are uploaded the extract would be kicked off. So paul will have access to run extract load indirectly.<br />
<br />
It will be helpful to proceed with these informations.<br />

Subject: Critical error - approving diagnostics<br />
<br />
&gt;Hi CDA Support,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;I ran into a critical error today with Forrest General that needs to be addressed ASAP in case it occurs with other automated members.&nbsp; I will give you a timeline of events and the emails I received:<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;June 1 &#8211; All mandatory SFTP files sent from Forrest General to Crimson<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;June 1 &#8211; Extract automatically kicked off and failed (see email message)<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;This e-mail is to notify you that the extract load you started for Load Instance April 2012 at 05:22 PM has been completed. There were one or more errors during the load. Your Business Analyst has been notified and is currently investigating the errors.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;June 4 &#8211; I didn&#8217;t have a chance to address these errors in the extract and had this on my list for today<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;June 5 &#8211; Paul Defreese uploaded additional Core Measure files (Paul does not have approval permissions)<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;June 5 &#8211; Extract load kicked off and diagnostics were automatically approved (let me emphasize Paul does not have these permissions to extract or approve)<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;The following file has been uploaded<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;'E:\\dmv3\\UploadedFiles\\ForrestGeneral\\May 2012\14-11-10-AM-06-05-2012HF Episode List 2011 Q4.csv'.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;*****<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;This e-mail is to notify you that the Crimson Support staff has received diagnostic report approval for Load Instance April 2012. The report was approved by user pdefreese at 06/05/2012 10:19 AM. Crimson staff will now initiate the next phase in the load process.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Please contact crimsonsupport@advisory.com for further information.<br />

&gt;This e-mail is to notify you that the diagnostic report for Load Instance April 2012 was approved by user pdefreese at 06/05/2012 10:19 AM.<br />

The multi approver check box is unchecked, which means, there are no multiple approvers for the client, and if any one of the user approve the diagnostics the load will be kicked off.

If the multiapprovers checkbox is checked, multiple users can be set to approve the diagnostics. And until all the users are approving the same, the load will not be kicked off.

The multi approver check box is unchecked, which means, there are no multiple approvers for the client, and if any one of the user approve the diagnostics the load will be kicked off.

If the multiapprovers checkbox is checked, multiple users can be set to approve the diagnostics. And until all the users are approving the same, the load will not be kicked off.

<br />
&gt;Correct, although it is my understanding that the only users that can approve the diagnostics were the ones that receive the emails and are checked off under the Member Contacts list.&#160; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;&#160;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;&#160;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;If I am understanding you correctly, any user that is in this list can approve diagnostics even if they are not checked off?<br />
&gt;<br />

I have noticed that with every release of citadel, the non generic loaders gets rearranged.   For example,  RWJUniversity  loader for user defined measures is set to run after discharge loaders, but earlier today, this loader was out of place.

 

Can you set make sure that these loaders remain in order with each citadel updates?

 

Thanks,

Sorry for a delayed reponse.
 We verified the current load order with service and this seems to be fine now.
 
We are working on the load order being picked from the predefined xml file (released by CCC team along with build artifacts), which will solve this issue on a permanent basis.

This issue is duplicated with the issue reported by stephanie. (37274)

Sorry for a delayed reponse.
 We verified the current load order with service and this seems to be fine now.
 
We are working on the load order being picked from the predefined xml file (released by CCC team along with build artifacts), which will solve this issue on a permanent basis.

This issue is duplicated with the issue reported by stephanie. (37274)

&gt;Hi,<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;I have noticed that with every release of citadel, the non generic loaders gets rearranged.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; RWJUniversity&nbsp; loader for user defined measures is set to run after discharge loaders, but earlier today, this loader was out of place.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Can you set make sure that these loaders remain in order with each citadel updates?<br />

Ben,
 
Perhaps it was SetupSearchServer.  This ticket is meant to capture a larger issue though, which is getting rid of granular record counts in general.  I know for instance this affects LoadPhysicianGeographicCoordinates.  I want this ticket to cover any other instances where counts are being displayed.

Citadel will be copying loaders locally from a network share for each load, which will solve this for long term. The feature is being worked out currently and will be released in the upcoming versions.

If this issue needs an immediate work around, probably CMA Loaders need to change the way to read the file in way that 2 process can access the file simutaneosly.

Hi Balijeet,

 

                         I am facing some issues with the DMV3 Diagnostics for the client St. Joseph Regional Health Center.  The load stats graph in the Diagnostics page for this client is not getting populated. 

I checked the respective diagnostic query that is responsible for populating this graph and it worked perfectly and returned the expected result. We need your help in resolving the graph issue.

 

 

Thanks,

Sharan

 

 

Hi Sharan,

 

As discussed, this is not a quick fix.

It seems issue with the chart control being used, chart is not able to map the lowest to higher range data.

 

Give us some time to find fix  / alternative to this. Will keep you posted.

I just talked with Baljeet.  Adena and Tift have load instance counts of 0.  As a workaround, can you try setting them back to quarterly, then set them back to monthly and set the kickoff date and see if that clears the problem?  Let me know whether that works as a temporary fix.

This is definitely a CDA issue, and Baljeet and I are working the issue.

Mary and Rob,

I just talked with Baljeet.  Adena and Tift have load instance counts of 0.  As a workaround, can you try setting them back to quarterly, then set them back to monthly and set the kickoff date and see if that clears the problem?  Let me know whether that works as a temporary fix.

This is definitely a CDA issue, and Baljeet and I are working the issue.

<br />
&gt;Hi All, <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;This was my original problem that I was trying to switch them from Quarterly to Monthly loads.&nbsp; Clinical Advantage seems to have disappeared during that process.&nbsp; I just tested this however to move them from M -&gt; Q and back to Monthly and that did the trick.&nbsp; <br />
&gt;<br />
&gt;Thanks!<br />
&gt;Mary<br />

My client “silverton” in DMV3 was recently moved to monthly loads from quarterly loads by the CDA team at my request and now I am receiving an error when I close out “Jan 2012” as no additional load instances are created so my client can no longer upload new files.  I have made sure my client is set to have 4 load instances at all times and when I try to mark “Jan 2012” as complete, it tells me the Load instance fails to save, but still moves it to “load history” but does not create any new load instances.  Since my client is trying to upload Feb 2012 now, can you please address this issue ASAP.

It looks like this client was moved from quarterly to monthly more than once, and as a result there were April-May-June-2012 entries in the DB.  Vijay says he corrected the production DB so that you should be able to complete the January load.  In the meantime, I'm going to add some code to CDA to eliminate the problem.

See the attached examples and screenshots for Alegent’s current data load which seems to be skewed for 7/2011.

 

1.       The DiagnosticTrend3 screenshot attachment shows the aggregated trend chart using the raw SQL query.

2.       The DiagnosticTrend screenshot attachment shows what the trend actually shows.

3.       The DiagnosticTrend2 shows what seems to be the problem.  It looks like the trend is not using the first raw row result from the SQL query.  The difference between the trend chart and the raw query for that month (7/2011) is exactly the number shown in the DiagnosticTrend2attachment.

I am unsure of how to submit CDA enhancement requests these days.  Please advise.

 

In the meantime, I would like to request a small enhancement to DMV3.

 

On the Scheduled Loads page, I would like to see a column for “Pre-Truncate” and “PostLoad SQL” when viewing the list of files that a Member has submitted.  This will allow us to quickly see if a table is set to Pre-Truncate or not, and to quickly see if the PostLoad SQL has been associated with the proper Load Requirement.  Currently, you have to toggle over to the Load Requirements page to see this information.  This is inefficient given the cumbersome nature of navigating in DMV3.  It would be really helpful to have this information available in the Scheduled Loads area as well.  And, further, it would be great if we could edit this information from the Scheduled Loads page.  So, if we need to check the Pre-Truncate box for a given load requirement or add a PostLoad SQL, you should be able to make this change from the Scheduled Loads page in addition to the Load Requirements page.

 

Thanks,

 

Scott

BAs / DA Leads,

This looks like a pretty big problem because the member thinks they have approved the link and the BA doesn’t get a notification from the DMV3 application.   I did some troubleshooting:

1.	The member approves the diagnostic but gets a prompt stating, “Diagnostic Approval Failed”
2.	The load instance gets moved to the load history, no approval email is sent to the member or BA/DA team, and the internal load is NOT kicked off
3.	You will be able to tell that the member “approved” the diagnostics by seeing the load instance in the Load History tab or looking at the diagnostic link and not seeing an “Approve” button within the newest link
4.	If any members have hit approved diagnostics since Wednesday evening CT, please make sure that the ticket is updated and you manually kick off the load for the time being in CITADEL to reduce delays in loads.

I have already talked to Curt Berry about the problem and he has it as a high priority for Vijay to look at and potentially fix.  Let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks!
